====== Royal Security Briefing: The Legion of Doom Crisis ======

**Classification:** Royal Eyes Only\\
**Issued By:** Princess Celestia\\
**Location:** Canterlot Arcane Network Archive\\

----

===== Summary =====
Equestria faces an unprecedented threat. A coordinated assault on our magical infrastructure has disrupted harmony across multiple regions. Early investigations confirm the involvement of Queen Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Lord Tirek, now operating together under the name Legion of Doom. 

Their attacks target not only physical defenses, but the very systems that maintain communication, record‑keeping, and magical balance throughout the realm. 

----

===== Current Situation =====
Recent disturbances include:

  * Corrupted spell‑records within the Canterlot Archives\\
  * Interference with long‑range communication crystals\\
  * Sudden drops in ambient harmony levels across major settlements\\
  * Unauthorized access attempts on restricted arcane systems\\


These disruptions appear coordinated and intentional. Their objective is believed to be **total domination of Equestria**.

----

===== Mission Directive =====
Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends are hereby tasked with:

  - Tracing signs of Legion activity across all affected systems
  - Documenting anomalies, corruption, or magical tampering
  - Restoring harmony flow where possible
  - Preventing further infiltration of the Canterlot network
  - Preserving evidence needed to reconstruct **Starswirl the Bearded’s banishment spell**

Every action taken must be recorded with accuracy. The integrity of this archive is essential for the final counterspell.

----

===== Known Adversaries =====
**Queen Chrysalis** – Expert in infiltration and deception\\
**Cozy Glow** – Strategist specializing in manipulation and misdirection\\
**Lord Tirek** – Capable of draining magic on a massive scale\\

Together, their combined abilities pose a threat unlike any previously encountered.

===== Final Note from Princess Celestia =====
Harmony is strained, but not broken. Trust in one another, remain vigilant, and let friendship guide your actions.
The fate of Equestria rests in your hooves.
