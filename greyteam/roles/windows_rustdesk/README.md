# windows_rustdesk

Installs the Rustdesk client on Windows systems.
Rustdesk is configured to use Password0 as the password and the RIT Cyberrange server.
Config is performed by loading a config file - this may or may not work. Official method needs Pro subscription.

NOT TESTED - deprecated by the fact that we don't need Rustdesk on Windows!

Current Rustdesk version is 1.4.5-x86, updated February 3rd 2026.
